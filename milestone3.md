UI Skeleton Webpages

Landing Page:
![Landing Page](landingPage.PNG)

The landing page is nearly identical to our first paper prototype. The simple skeleton of the webpage includes the
app name at the top of the page, an image of a cat underneath the title, a description of what the app provides,
and a button that takes the user to the next page to begin customizing his or her cat. One difference is that the
skeleton does not contain a help button yet. However, other than that, the UI skeleton is made exactly the way we
had planned.
