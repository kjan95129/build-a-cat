UI Skeleton Webpages

Landing Page:

No change.

Cat Personalization Page:
![Customize Page](UISkeleton/m5Customize.png)

In our latest version of Build-a-cat, we included an option for users to select a fur color they prefer for their ideal cat.
Because the customization page is already fairly simple, we displayed the color choices below the sliders rather than
creating a dropdown for the colors. This way, all stylistic options are immediately visible and the user does not have to
take extra steps/clicks to navigate through customizing options. Right above the array of colors we display the color the
user has chosen with "black" as the default color. The border of the cat image also changes according to the color the user
selects.


Results Page:

![Results - Bottom](UISkeleton/m5ResultsTwo.png)

The format in which the resulting cat images are displayed has been changed to resemble the way Pinterest displays relevant
pins. This way, the user is able to scroll through the images without any awkward gaps from different sized cats pictures.
The images also have rounded corners, making the resulting gallery look less harsh, and more lovable.


Non-Trivial User Actions

(1) Sliders: Users use the sliders to manipulate the facial features of the cat, which are reflected on the cat's face
on the page in real time, creating a click and drag effect. Then based on the user's preferences, the results page displays
a variety of cat images that reflect the facial feature proportions and distances that the user input.

(2) Color picking: Users click on the color of the cat they want, which is reflected on the cat's image. Rather than the entire
cat's face color changing, just the border of the cat is changed when the user clicks on a new color. This is to keep a clean
design and to also keep the color from distracting the user from the cat's facial features.
