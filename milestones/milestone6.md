UI Skeleton Webpages

Landing Page:
![Landing Page](UISkeleton/m6Landing.png)

We changed the background colors to make the home page more colorful, aesthetic, and eye catching.

Cat Customization Page:
![Customization Page](UISkeleton/m6Customize.png)

We changed the main text of the page from "Customize your cat" to "Build your cat" to be more consistent
with our app name. Additionally, we added circular buttons on the top right of the page with options that
allow users to navigate to different pages within the app including the "Home" button, the "Cat" or customization
page button, "Cat facts" button, a "petfinder" button, and the "help" button. The "petfinder" button links to
another website called Petfinder that helps people find the ideal pet they want to adopt.

Cat Results Page:
![Cat Results Page Top](UISkeleton/m6Results.png)
![Cat Results Page Bottom](UISkeleton/m6Results2.png)

We added the same buttons from the cat customization page to allow users to continue to navigate through the
app even when they may be done using the app. We also added a "Check out cat adopting" button that leads to
the "Cat Facts" page to encourage users to view statistics regarding cat adoptions, and hopefully adopt more
cats!
