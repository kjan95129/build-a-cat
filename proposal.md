Build-A-Cat

Idea 1: Cats


We would use a dataset of 9,000 photos of cats and their facial features and allow the user to input their preferences of their ideal cat (through 
custom facial feature dimensions). As of now we plan on doing this by providing click and drag features to allow users to customize their cat. Then taking the facial proportions of the user's ideal cat, we would recommend them a cat by 
displaying pictures of the cats that fit their ideal cat facial 
features.

 This would be under the "discovery and recommendations" theme suggested on the project webpage.

Idea 2: World Happiness Levels



We want to show how happy people are based on their location, but also show the other factors that determine these happiness levels compared to a "dystopia." We would show a map, and when a user clicks on a location, we would show the other statistics that make up what contributes to the happiness levels of that location. We will also show the rankings of happiness levels relative to other locations.

Idea 3: Schooling
 and Happiness

If families want to move somewhere, we want to show the correlation between happiness, schooling, life expectancy, and wealth based on the countries the families may be interested in. It's very similar to idea 2, but it's geared to families that are considering schools and overall well-being.
