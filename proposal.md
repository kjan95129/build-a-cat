Idea 1: Cats

(Build-A-Cat???)

We have a dataset of 9,000 photos of cats and their facial features, and we 
would allow the user to input their preferences of their ideal cat (through
custom facial feature dimensions) and we would recommend them a cat by 
displaying a picture of one of the cats that fit their ideal cat facial
features.

 This would be under the "discovery and recommendations" theme suggested on the project webpage.

Idea 2: World Happiness Levels



We want to show how happy people are based on their location, but also show the other factors that determine these happiness levels compared to a "dystopia."

Idea 3: Schooling
 and Happiness
If families want to move somewhere, we want to show the correlation between happiness, schooling, life expectancy, and wealth based on the countries the families may be interested in.
