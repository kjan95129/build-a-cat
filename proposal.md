Idea 1: Cats

(Build-A-Cat???)

We have a dataset of 9,000 photos of cats and their facial features, and we 
would allow the user to input their preferences of their ideal cat (through
custom facial feature dimensions) and we would recommend them a cat by 
displaying a picture of one of the cats that fit their ideal cat facial
features.
