Sally Lai U Set up the Firebase and stored the user input of the users' cat TODO
"I set up firebase and stored the user input of people's cat features preferences (color, eye distance, ear distance, eye to mouth distance), so heero can grab from it and display it on the data visuablization page. Oh i also did the narration of the video."

Kate Wong:
  pre-processed the cat images database and annotations to find the distances between the eyes, length of ears,
  distance from the eyes to mouth, identifying the colors of the cats, and coming up with algorithm to find the
  cats the user actually wants (mapping the values from the database to what the user inputs)
  also added some of the data visualizations after parsing the data from the los angeles animal intake information
  in Python
