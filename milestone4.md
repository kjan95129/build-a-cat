Addressing User Privacy:
Our web application does not gather user information other than what cat facial proportions the user prefers.
Even with the preferences that the user inputs, we only use that information to filter through the cat
database and provide the user with the results that most fit their criteria. These preferences are not saved
or used for anything else.
